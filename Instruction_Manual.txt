Instruction Manual
"A_Tkinter_BasicCode" is the game source code.
For using the scoreboard feature too please run the program from "mysql python" from IDLE.
When running the code for first time on a computer decomment the following lines :

#mycon.execute("CREATE DATABASE scoreboard")
#mycon.execute("CREATE TABLE highscore(name VARCHAR(30), score smallint)")

When running the code anytime else please do ensure that the above lines commented out.


Keep all files and Images in the same folder with no partition within the folder to avoid directory error.

Due to changing resolution from device to device the picture might be distorted.
For best experience, do not maximise the window and keep it in it's original dimension (630 x 630 px).

Please do enter your database and other mysql details in the file "mysql python" here:

db=mysql.connector.connect(
    host=<hostname>,
    user=<username>,
    passwd=<password>,
    database=<database name>
    )
